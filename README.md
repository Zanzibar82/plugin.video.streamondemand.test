# plugin.video.streamondemand
Italian son of pelisalacarta v4.0.3,
and only with Italian channels:
STREAM ON DEMAND
Fixed all new options with Italian channels,
translated the tweaked "buscador general" in Italian.
The downloadable .zip can be installed directly into Kodi.
It is suggested to remove any other pelisalacarta version first, restart Kodi and then install this.
Removed channels not in italian (sorry but that also makes the plugin lighter)
Removed adult options and contents for 2 reasons:

1) I have nephews age 3-16 and I don't want them to display by accident
adult contents on their parent's devices. I'll think about putting them back
if we find a password-entry solution.

2) there are TONS of ways to get to adult contents, even with Kodi.

Please note that for migrating the job from 3.9 to 4.0.3 I helped myself
with dentaku65's good work at start, but basically started back from skratch.
